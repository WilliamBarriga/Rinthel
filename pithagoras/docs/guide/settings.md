# Settings

Settings open from the bottom of the sidebar, or `/settings`. Navigation runs
down the left edge: **General**, **Channels**, **Extensions**, **Advanced**, plus
a page for every extension that exposes configuration.

There is no Session tab. Model, effort and context all live on the pills under
the composer, and a second copy here would be two places to keep in sync.

## General

Defaults for newly created sessions, and read-only deployment facts — the
executor, the workspace root, and where pi's `settings.json` lives.

The fields show **only your explicit overrides**. Leave one empty and it
inherits, with the inherited value shown as the placeholder. Clearing a field
hands the setting back to pi; clicking the active effort level again unsets it.

This matters more than it sounds. An earlier version prefilled each field with
the *resolved* value, so one click of Save pinned an inherited setting forever —
which is how a portal could end up permanently stuck on a model nobody chose.

### Where a model comes from

Resolved in order, first match wins:

1. The session's own choice, from the pill under the composer
2. A portal override, saved here in General
3. `PI_PROVIDER` / `PI_MODEL` / `PI_THINKING_LEVEL` in the environment
4. `defaultProvider` / `defaultModel` / `defaultThinkingLevel` in pi's `settings.json`
5. A last-resort constant

Steps 4 and 5 are the point: an install configured through the pi CLI behaves
the same in the portal without being configured twice.

::: tip Models from extensions
A model provided by an extension — anything under a `llama-server=…` provider —
does not exist until extensions are bound, which happens after the session is
created. The portal resolves the model a second time after binding. Without
that, a session asking for a local model silently started on pi's fallback.
:::

## Channels

Two-way links into the agent, and the packages that provide them. See
[Agent and channels](/channels/).

## Extensions

Install, update and remove pi packages, from npm, a git repository, a URL or a
local path. The list comes from the server's parsed view of `pi list` — the
browser used to re-parse it and listed some packages twice.

Any extension whose settings the server can recover gets its own page in the
navigation, with a field per key.

::: warning Recovered, not declared
pi publishes no schema for extension settings — extensions simply read keys off
the settings object. The portal recovers them by reading the package source,
which is a heuristic: a key built dynamically at runtime will not appear. Use
Advanced to edit `settings.json` directly when that happens.
:::

## Advanced

pi's raw `settings.json`, edited in place. It is validated as JSON before
writing — a broken file stops every future session from starting, so an invalid
save is refused rather than accepted.
