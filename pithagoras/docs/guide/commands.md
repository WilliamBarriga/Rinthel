# Slash commands

Type `/` in the composer and the palette lists everything available in that
session. Commands are matched against the real list, so a message that merely
begins with a path — `/etc/hosts is wrong` — is still sent as a message.

A command that opens a dialog does not appear in the transcript. Its menu is the
feedback; a chat bubble saying `/models` would be noise.

## Where they come from

| Source | Provided by |
| --- | --- |
| `builtin` | The portal |
| `extension` | An installed pi package |
| `prompt` | A prompt template |
| `skill` | A skill |

## Builtins

pi's builtin commands are implemented by whichever mode is running — the TUI
draws its own — so the portal supplies them. The names and descriptions are read
from the SDK's own `BUILTIN_SLASH_COMMANDS`, so they track pi's releases rather
than drifting from a copy.

Only the ones the portal can actually service are offered. `/quit`, `/hotkeys`,
`/trust` and the auth commands are terminal concerns; listing them would be a
menu of things that quietly do nothing.

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `/compact` | Summarise the conversation to free context |
| `/session` | Model, effort, context, tokens, cost, tool calls |
| `/export` | Write the session out — HTML, or `.jsonl` if you name one |
| `/reload` | Reload extensions, skills, prompts and settings |
| `/model` | Open the model picker |
| `/settings` | Open settings |
| `/new` | Start a session in this workspace |
| `/name` | Rename the session |

The first four act on the session server-side and report through the event
stream. The rest open portal UI and never reach pi.

`/compact` is not awaited — it is a model call, and holding the HTTP request
open for it would time out. It reports when it finishes.

## Extension commands

Anything an installed package registers appears automatically. Install
`pi-llama-cpp` and `/models` shows up, opening the same menu the TUI draws:

```
/models  [extension]  Browse Llama.cpp models
```

Interactive commands work because the portal binds a UI context when it creates
the session. Without one, pi hands the extension a default immediately and a
command that asks a question appears to do nothing. Dialogs are rendered as a
modal — select, confirm, input and editor are all supported.

Dialog events are deliberately never persisted. A stored one would be replayed
to every future reader, so reloading the page reopened a menu whose extension
had long since stopped waiting.

## Adding more

Install a pi package from [Settings → Extensions](/guide/extensions). Its
commands appear the next time the palette refreshes, which happens when a run
ends — no reload needed.
