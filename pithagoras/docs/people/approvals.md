# Approvals

A colleague hitting a wall is the normal case, not a failure. What matters is
that the wall has a door in it.

## Asking

When somebody needs something their role does not cover, the agent puts it to
you with `ask_primary`, and it arrives wherever [routine reports](/guide/routines)
go:

```
Priya is asking (via telegram):

Priya wants me to check the inbox and summarise anything urgent.

It wants to run, exactly once:

    himalaya envelope list --mailbox Inbox --page-size 3

Approving runs that and nothing else.
```

The agent chooses neither the recipient nor the route. A session working for
somebody else must not be able to pick who hears from it.

## Answering

Three answers. On a channel that draws buttons you get **Approve once**,
**Always allow** and **Deny**; everywhere else the same thing as text:

| Reply | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `#abcd approve` | That exact command runs, once, within 15 minutes |
| `#abcd always` | Writes a [standing rule](/people/rules) for that person |
| `#abcd no` | Refused, and they are told |

Anything else is relayed to them as an ordinary answer and **authorises
nothing**. Only the literal word `always` creates a standing permission —
something that outlives the conversation should never come from a reply that
merely sounded enthusiastic.

The `#abcd` prefix is what makes it an answer rather than a remark. It is
matched only at the start of a message and only against a question still
waiting, so a message that merely begins with a hash reaches the agent normally.

::: tip Buttons are the text
A button's payload is exactly the message it stands for. Tapping **Approve
once** sends `#abcd approve` down the same path as typing it, so nothing behaves
differently depending on how you answered.

## What happens next

The conversation picks itself back up. The agent runs what was approved and
tells the person who asked what came of it — you do not go and prod it, and
neither do they.

A refusal resumes it too. Being told no is an outcome worth delivering; silence
reads as the question having been lost.

The resumed turn runs **as that conversation**, so a colleague's session is
still a colleague's session. The approval permits one action inside it, not a
promotion.

## What an approval is not

::: warning It authorises the command you were shown
One conversation, one use, fifteen minutes. Matching is exact — approving
`himalaya envelope list --page-size 3` does not cover `--page-size 5`, which is
the safe failure direction and does mean an approval can quietly not apply if
the agent rephrases.
:::

Saying yes to one command does not make somebody trusted for the next one. If
you find yourself approving the same thing repeatedly, that is what **Always
allow** is for.

## When the answer cannot get back

Some channels can only reply to a message already open — a webhook without a
callback URL. Asking still works: the question reaches you, and the answer is
held and delivered the next time that person writes. The notification says which
of the two you are getting.
